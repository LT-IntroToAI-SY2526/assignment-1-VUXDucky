MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I have some experience with [mention your previous programming language if any, or say 'I'm new to programming']. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover:

Variables and basic data types
Conditionals (if/elif/else)
Loops (for and while)
Functions
Basic list operations
Make them progressively more challenging. Make sure each problem has clear instructions and example inputs/outputs.

Example: "Problem 1: Temperature Converter

Topic: Variables and basic data types

Instructions:
Write a program that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Use the formula:
Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32

Input: A number representing degrees in Celsius.
Output: The equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit.

Example:

Input: 25
Output: 77.0

✅ Problem 2: Even or Odd Checker

Topic: Conditionals

Instructions:
Write a program that checks whether a number is even or odd.

Input: An integer.
Output: "Even" if the number is even, otherwise "Odd".

Example:

Input: 7
Output: Odd

✅ Problem 3: Count to Number

Topic: Loops (for loop)

Instructions:
Write a program that takes a positive integer n and prints all numbers from 1 to n, one per line.

Input: A positive integer.
Output: A list of numbers from 1 to n.

Example:

Input: 5
Output:
1
2
3
4
5

✅ Problem 4: Password Retry System

Topic: Loops (while loop) + Conditionals

Instructions:
Write a program that lets the user try to enter a password. They have 3 attempts.
The correct password is "python123".
If they enter it correctly, print "Access granted".
If they fail 3 times, print "Access denied".

Example:

Input: hello
Input: pass
Input: python123
Output: Access granted

Input: test
Input: test2
Input: test3
Output: Access denied

✅ Problem 5: Find the Maximum

Topic: Lists and loops

Instructions:
Write a function called find_max(numbers) that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest number.

Input: A list of integers.
Output: The largest integer in the list.

Example:

Input: [4, 9, 1, 22, 5]
Output: 22

✅ Problem 6: Sum of Multiples

Topic: Loops + Conditionals + Functions

Instructions:
Write a function sum_of_multiples(n) that returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to n that are divisible by 3 or 5.

Input: A positive integer n.
Output: The sum of all numbers ≤ n divisible by 3 or 5.

Example:

Input: 10
Output: 33
# (3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10)

✅ Problem 7: Remove Even Numbers

Topic: Lists + Loops + Functions

Instructions:
Write a function remove_evens(numbers) that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with all even numbers removed.

Input: A list of integers.
Output: A new list containing only the odd numbers.

Example:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: [1, 3, 5]
